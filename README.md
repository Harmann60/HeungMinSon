## 🌟 **About the Project**

This website is a personal tribute to Heung-Min Son — highlighting his journey from humble beginnings in South Korea to becoming one of the most admired footballers in the Premier League.

##🌍 Vision

There are dedicated websites for global icons like Messi and Ronaldo — but Heung-Min Son, one of the most hardworking and humble players of our generation, doesn’t have a website that truly captures his journey and spirit.
This project aims to fill that gap by creating a beautiful, fan-driven digital space where fans can celebrate Son’s passion, discipline, and incredible story.
